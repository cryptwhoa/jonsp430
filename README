jonsp430 is a custom emulator for the MSP430 to assist in the microcorruption CTF (www.microcorruption.com).

There exist discrepancies between the emulator in the CTF and the official Texas Instruments spec.  jonsp430 follows the CTF's emulator.

Features in jonsp430 which cannot be found in the CTF's emulator:
* Random seed specification.  You can use the same random seed between sessions.
* Memory watchpoints.  You can choose to stop execution if a memory address is accessed.
* Logging functionality.  You can have jonsp430 write all instructions it executes to a file, along with the values contained in the src and dst registers, and the values contained in the memory pointed at by the src and dst registers.

Current limitations:
* Only one breakpoint may be set.
* Resetting an instance may be unreliable; you may just want to exit the program and reload/rerun if you need to restart.
* No register watchpoints.
* The levels included are the versions that I was given.  I heard someone saying that levels slightly vary by user as an anti-cheat mechanism, but haven't confirmed it myself.
